# Project_Alzheimer-s
Developed a lightweight deep learning model for classifying Alzheimer’s disease stages using MRI scans, enabling early, accurate, and interpretable diagnosis. Implemented a WCNN with Haar DWT, achieving 95.63% accuracy—surpassing CNN (84.53%) and DCNN (93.44%)—while handling class imbalance with SMOTE and improving interpretability via Grad-CAM.
